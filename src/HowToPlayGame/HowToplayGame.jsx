        <p>Welcome to the Matching Game! Here is how to play:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Match pairs of cards before time runs out.</li>
          <li><strong>Select Cards:</strong> Click a card to reveal its image.</li>
          <li><strong>Make a Match:</strong> Find and click the matching card.</li>
          <li><strong>Lives:</strong> You have a limited number of lives. A mismatch costs one life.</li>
          <li><strong>Levels:</strong> Complete all levels by matching all pairs in each level.</li>
          <li><strong>Time:</strong> Each level has a time limit. Beat the clock to advance!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember, quick thinking and a good memory are your best tools.</p>
        <p>Good luck! from Team 3</p>
